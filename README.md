## Fractalscope

### Background

The Mandlebrot set is a famous fractal which shows the beauty and chaos
that emerge when complex numbers are repeatedly subjected to polynomial
transformations. It is named after Benoit Mandlebrot, a Polish-born
mathematician who poineered the field of 'fractal geometry' and the use
of computers to generate fractal images. He discovered the Mandlebrot set
in 1979.

They algorithm that generates this canonical fractal is:
  Z(i + 1) = (Z(i))^2 + k
where k is the value of a point on the complex plane. Images of this
fractal are generated by calculating repeated iterations of the above
function, and testing to see if the value of Z(i) has escaped from a
predetermined boundary. Typically the boundary is set to abs(Z(i)) < 4,
since numbers greater than 4 will grow quickly when squared. Complex
numbers less than 4, however do not all diverge under this function,
since the 'imaginary' component may square to a negative 'real' value.

The image displayed is generated by applying this calculation to each
point on the complex plane, and coloring the corresponding pixel based
on how many iterations of the function it takes to escape the boundary.
Points that remain bounded are in the set. Points that escape will be
assigned a color depending on the number of iterations it takes to
diverge.

### Functionality & MVP  

This fractalscope will be able to:

- [ ] render the Mandlebrot set image.
- [ ] Zoom in or out on a given location in the complex plane.
- [ ] Pan the center location.
- [ ] Export, save, or download the image.

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] A link to the Mandlebrot Set wikipedia package
- [ ] Links to my personal page, the github repo, and my LinkedIn
- [ ] A production Readme

### Wireframes

This project will be a single interactive panel with a large canvas
element and various control panels around it. The user will be able to
make adjustments to the image by clicking on the control panels.

### Architecture and Technologies

#### Technologies
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla Javascript
- 'jscolor' for color picking,
- `HTML5 Canvas` for image rendering,
- Webpack to bundle, transpile, and serve up the various scripts.

#### Architecture
One main script will keep track of the setting selected in each of the
control panels. When any setting is updated, a renderFractal method will
be called. The actual function that calculates the pixel colors to draw
the fractal will live in a separate script called drawMandlebrot. Yet
another script will manage the color settings.

Scripts:
- main.js
- drawMandlebrot.js
- updateColors.js

Several canvases will be stacked on top of each other to improve UI. At
the lowest level the fractal canvas will hold the image. Then, a
transparent grid canvas will hold a reference grid to show the current
real/imaginary components of square that is currently in view. Finally,
a transparent dragging canvas will live on top that allows the user to
grab and drag the image to pan around fractal. This will be in addition
to panning with the arrow keys or arrow buttons.

Canvas stack:
- dragging
- grid
- fractal

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**:
Set up the basic layout, including the layered canvases.
Implement the grid to show coordinates and the dragging canvas to allow
panning.

Day 1 goals:
- Have components appear on screen.
- Implement grid and panning.

**Day 2**:
Get the Zoom feature to zoom the viewport in on. Get the drawMandlebrot
function to render a two-color image of the Mandlebrot set with a static
value for the maximum number of iterations calculated. Then, make the
maximum iterations value dynamic so the user can select how detailed
he or she wants the image to be.

Day 2 goals:
- Have basic 2-color Mandlebrot image rendering on the canvas
- make MAX_ITERATIONS variable set dynamically.

**Day 3**:
Get the color picker feature working so that the user can choose what
colors the image will be. Then, enhance the color picker to include a
cycleLength variable. The color cycle will repeat up to the MAX_ITERATIONS
value. So, for example if a user selects the MAX_ITERATIONS as 100, and
then chooses a color cycleLength of 10, the colors in their palette
should repeat 10 times from the innermost part of the image to the
outermost part.

Day 3 goals:
- Get color picker working
- Get nice color selection feedback to show up in the color selector
panel, including a value for the cycleLength
- Make the Mandlebrot image render with the selected colors.

**Day 4**:
Style the panels and text to look polished. Attempt to implement color
rotation.

Day 4 goals:
- Make it look good.
- Add a `rotate colors` button to toggle color rotation feature on/off.
- If time: add rotation speed dial to control rate of color rotation.


### Bonus features

There are many enhancements that could make this fractalscope even
better:

- [ ] timed color rotation
- [ ] enhance color picking selection details
- [ ] display corresponding Julia sets
